* First-person shooter made with [Godot 4.2.x (dev version)](https://godotengine.org/download/)
* Expect anything completely random, except for right now, since I havn't really made anything yet.
* This will hopefully evolve into a comical randomized experience.

## Development
### Planing
* I am attempting to impliment the method described in this excellent 4-part series on networking: [https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/client-server-game-architecture.html](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/client-server-game-architecture.html)<br>I'll start with the first method described, the "dumb" server, with no client-side simulation or compensation.
### Contributing
* Anyone except Bill Gates is welcome to contribute
* Please read all of the article above if you are new to networking
